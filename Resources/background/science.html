<h3>The Science Behind the Pictures</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="faq">Q:</span> <i>What am I looking at?</i><p>

<p><span class="faq">A:</span> You are looking at an N-dimensional <a href="#def:SK_model">SK model</a> in which the <a href="#def:energy_surface">energy surface</a>
consists of two <a href="#def:isotropic_potential_well">isotropic potential wells</a> centered on two distinct points
<span class="def">p1</span> and <span class="def">p2</span>. Points on the hemispherical shell shown in the pictures
represent <a href="#def:equivalence_class">equivalence classes</a> of the points in the SK model's configuration space.
The equivalence classes are defined in terms of distance in <a href="#def:configuration_space">configuration space</a>: all points in a given equivalence
class are <i>k1</i> steps from p1 and <i>k2</i> steps from p2. The two equivalence classes respectively containing
p1 and p2 themselves are located on the shell's equator.</p>

<p>Let's unpack that.</p>

<hr>

<p>Four numbers are sufficient to define the fundamental properties of the model:
<ul>
    <li><span class="def">N</span>, the dimensionality of the SK model</li>
    <li><span class="def">k0</span>, the distance between p1 and p2</li>
    <li><span class="def">&#x03B1;1</span>, the depth of the potential well centered on p1</li>
    <li><span class="def">&#x03B1;2</span>, the depth of the well centered on p2</li>
</ul>
The thermodynamic properties also depend on:
<ul>
    <li><span class="def">T</span>, temperature (alternatively expressed in terms of <span class="def">&#x03B2;</span> &#x2261; 1/T)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<p><a anchor="def:configuration_space"/>In general, the <span class="def">configuration space</span> of a system is the space of all
possible configurations of that system. Each <a href="def:degree_of_freedom">degree of freedom</a> in the
system is assigned its own dimension in configuration space. Each possible configuration is a distinct point
in the space.</p>

<p>For example: a light-switch has two possible configurations "off" and "on"; its configuration space is a
1-dimensional space containing two points. A system consisting of two light-switches has two degrees of
freedom and four possible configurations: [off, off], [off, on], [on, off], [on, on]; its configuration
space is a 2-dimensional space containing four points. A system of N light-switches has an N-dimensional
configuration space containing 2^N points.</p>

<p>In the N-dimensional <a href="#def:SK_mode">SK model</a> there are N spins, each of which can take on values +1 or -1;
