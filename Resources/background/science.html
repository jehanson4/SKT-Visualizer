<h3>The Science Behind the Pictures</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="faq">Q:</span> <i>What am I looking at?</i><p>

<p><span class="faq">A:</span> You are looking at the <a href="#def:configuration_space">configuration space</a> of an N-dimensional <a href="#def:SK_model">SK model</a> in which the <a href="#def:energy_surface">energy surface</a> consists of two <a href="#def:isotropic_potential_well">isotropic potential wells</a> centered on two distinct points <b>p1</b> and <b>p2</b>. Locations on the hemispherical <i>Surface</i> represent <a href="#def:equivalence_class">equivalence classes</a> of points in the configuration space, with each equivalence class located at the crossing of two lines in the <i>Net</i>. The equivalence classes are defined in terms of distance in configuration space: all points in a given equivalence class are <i>k1</i> steps from p1 and <i>k2</i> steps from p2. The two equivalence classes respectively containing p1 and p2 themselves are located at the feet of the two <i>Meridians</i>.</p>

<p>Let's unpack that.</p>

<p>[ . . . ]</p>

<p>Four numbers are sufficient to define the fundamental properties of the model:
<ul>
    <li><b>N</b>, the dimensionality of the SK model</li>
    <li><b>k0</b>, the distance between <math>p1</math> and p2</li>
    <li><b>&#x03B1;1</b>, the depth of the potential well centered on p1</li>
    <li><b>&#x03B1;2</b>, the depth of the well centered on p2</li>
</ul>
The thermodynamic properties also depend on:
<ul>
    <li><b>T</b>, temperature (alternatively expressed in terms of <b>&#x03B2;</b> &#x2261; 1/T)</li>
</ul>
