<p>The <a anchor="def#distinguished_points"><span class="def">distinguished points</span> p1 and p2 are two points in the SK model's configuration space--i.e., two configurations--that are a specified distance apart. Because the space is homogeneous, the choice of p1 is arbitrary. For the same reason, p2 may be any point at the correct distance from p1.</p>
    
    <p>Distance between two configurations is the number of spins that differ. A single spin-flip will change any configuration into another one that is at a distance 1&mdash;i.e., 1 step away&mdash;from the original.</p>

<p>Four numbers are sufficient to define the fundamental properties of the model:
<ul>
    <li><span class="def">N</span>, the dimensionality of the SK model</li>
    <li><span class="def">k0</span>, the distance between p1 and p2</li>
    <li><span class="def">&#x03B1;1</span>, the depth of the potential well centered on p1</li>
    <li><span class="def">&#x03B1;2</span>, the depth of the well centered on p2</li>
</ul>
The thermodynamic properties also depend on:
<ul>
    <li><span class="def">T</span>, temperature (alternatively expressed as
        <span class="def">&#x03B2;</span> &#x2261; 1/T)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In general, the <span class="def">configuration space</span> of a system is the space of all
possible configurations of that system. Each <a href="def:degree_of_freedom">degree of
freedom</a> in the system is assigned its own dimension in configuration space. Each possible
configuration is a distinct point in the space.</p>

<p>A single configuration in the SK model consists of N binary variables (aka "spins") whose
possible values are conventionally written "+1" and "-1". Accordingly, there are 2^N distinct
configurations possible to the system. Each spin is a degree of freedom, so the configuration
space has N dimensions.</p>
