<ul>
    <li><b>Tap</b> the main window to start or stop the sequencer</li>
    <li><b>Drag</b> a finger on it to rotate the scene</li>
    <li><b>Pinch</b> to zoom</li>
</ul>

<h4><a anchor="color_mapping">Color Mapping</h4>

<p>For most color sources, the color maps are all calibrated to divide the range of observed values (of energy or whatever) into approximately equal divisions, assigning one color per division. There are two cycles of 6 colors, making twelve divisions overall.</p>
<p>It's important to note that they are recalibrated every time the system changes. This means that you can't really compare the colors observed at two different parameter settings or at two different frames in an animation.</p>
<p>The exception to the above is the "Basins" color source, which maps each discovered basin to its own color (gradually washing it out as distince to the attrator increases). Boundary nodes are black and unclassified nodes are gray.</p>

<h4><a anchor="sequencers">Sequencers</h4>

<p><b>Population Flow</b> sequencers operate by applying a <b>local rule</b> to a
time-varying population of configurations distributed among the nodes. (Node population
is displayed by the <i>Population</i> Color Source.) The initial distribution is
chosen to match equilibrium occupancy values at high temperature. Each step of the
sequencer applies the local rule to all nodes simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Local rules:
<ul>
    <li><b>Steepest Descent:</b> Find lowest-energy neighbor, move the node's population to that neighbor</li>
    <li><b>Any Descent:</b> Find all downhill neighbors, move population to them all to them in equal proportions</li>
    <li><b>&#x0394;E-aware Descent:</b> Move to downhill neighbors in proportion to energy change of the transition</li>
    <li><b>Metropolis Flow:</b> Apply the Metropolis rule @ T = current system temperature</li>
</ul>
