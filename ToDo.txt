ABOVE THE LINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BELOW THE LINE

[ ] move that blockquote to main BG page

[ ] automatically select color source = population when sequencer selection changes
    to a pop-flow sequencer from sth else.

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color

[ ] Sequencer Reset button

[ ] pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] Delta button may not be working; or else update are piling up

[ ] 'game mode'
    this is to get apple to approve it.
    ? maybe you get to break links?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

    sequencer methods:
        reset() - puts it back to whatever it regards as an initial state
        step()
        reverse()
    but nothing that says, re-derive params

[ ] block the back half of the nodes
    maybe 2 intersecting vertical flat semicircles @ phi=0 & phi=pi/2

3 directions:
[ ] more: particle flow
[ ] again: macOS
[ ] better: offload more heavy tasks to background thread

[ ] UI for pop flow rule selection

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[ ] use NSLog not print
    find out about log levels too

[ ] only execute a clear-and-redraw when needed
    (actual frame rate is handled by . . . whom? GLKView?)

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] PhysicalProperty -> DerivedProperty

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] page 2 POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] verify that all the change monitor guys impl the new protocol

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] segue from background to prev, not always back to main

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.

[ ] button to take screenshot of the currently displayed view
