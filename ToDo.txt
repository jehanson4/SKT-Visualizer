[?] sequencer=sweep over a1, but sequencer delta is not reading from a1 delta

[?] delta T stepper gives nonsense value if you go down from 10

[?] delta a1 and delta a2 steppers won't go down below 0.01
...perhaps b/c their own incr is 0.01

[?] model params controls got disconnected after a bunch of model & figure changes
...basins reset params didn't work
...sequencer controls got disconnected

[?] autocalibrate not ALWAYS working for occupation in the plane
...switch figures when autocalibrate is on, doesn't recalibrate before showing the new
figure
...change N: doesn't auto recalibrate

[?] pop flow calibration is wrong, it goes black in the middle even when recalibrated

I think log dataprovider is wrong, it doesn't drain out of high-energy states
but rather they all go up up up if you don't recalibrate

update release notes
build 9: I forget. What was the thing in the notes to testers?
build 10: new UI preview



ABOVE THE LINE

BELOW THE LINE



option to save current model params as defaults

reset model params doesn't reset the timeseries sequencer, but I think it should

figure selection has 2 sections: plane and hemi

surface

descent lines

any-descent basins

[ ] EFFECTS clean up after themselves when disabled

[?] Name of the thing that changes over time is copied into min/max/delta

[ ] degeneracy-aware arrow length

[ ] net's arcs drawn as spherical ellipses not line segments. I.e., many tiny line
	segments.

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] recheck: pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] for Delta to work, loop needs to be inside BG work item

[ ] recheck: on change flow sequencer, stepnumber doesn't get reset properly
    timing thing? -- ui updates before rule-change completes

[ ] recheck: N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color right

[ ] something to get it past Apple's prohibition of 'niche apps' in the App Store
    "game mode"?
    maybe you get to rewire the graph?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] macOS version

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.
