[ ] better sync in basins. I'm still getting node-index ut of bounds and
    crazy stripes

[ ] plane POV doesn't recenter when you change N or k

[ ] start, go to eq, pick a figure, change effects. switch from eq to dynamics,
choose initial figure that's got the same base as the eq one
...either desn't update the figure, or inherits its effects settings but doesn't
update the UI correctly

[?] delta T stepper gives nonsense value if you go down from 10

[?] model params controls got disconnected after a bunch of model & figure changes
...basins reset params didn't work
...sequencer controls got disconnected

[?] pop flow calibration goes black in the middle even when recalibrated.
    But maybe that's right...

I think log dataprovider is wrong, it doesn't drain out of high-energy states
but rather they all go up up up if you don't recalibrate. they should go DOWN, right?

BELOW THE LINE



option to save current model params as defaults

reset model params doesn't reset the timeseries sequencer, but I think it should

figure selection has 2 sections: plane and hemi

surface

descent lines

any-descent basins

[ ] EFFECTS clean up after themselves when disabled

[?] Name of the thing that changes over time is copied into min/max/delta

[ ] degeneracy-aware arrow length

[ ] net's arcs drawn as spherical ellipses not line segments. I.e., many tiny line
	segments.

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] recheck: pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] for Delta to work, loop needs to be inside BG work item

[ ] recheck: on change flow sequencer, stepnumber doesn't get reset properly
    timing thing? -- ui updates before rule-change completes

[ ] recheck: N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color right

[ ] something to get it past Apple's prohibition of 'niche apps' in the App Store
    "game mode"?
    maybe you get to rewire the graph?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] macOS version

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.
