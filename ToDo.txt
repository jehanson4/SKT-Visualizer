For 1.0.7

[ ] BUG: Close the Visualizer, then start it up again. Click once on + to
	increase alpha2 to -0.99. Click on Color Source and select Basins. Boom. iOS 11.3.

    inside BAModel is a duplicate physics & geometry. We change the main physics,
    which tells BAModel to update its parameters with a 'reset'. but the BAModel's
    geometry is wrong.

[ ] BUG: the colorsource & sequencer UI is confusing.
	Some of the sequencers are timeseries, some are param sweeps. They place constraints
	on choice of color source. E.g., steve was doing timeseries while looking at basins.

    [ ] when the sequencer changes, fix the color source
        each sequencer has a progressionType
        there's one color source that takes snapshots of a timeseries: PopulationFlow
        flow models have steps

        OH! there's a specific data source or backing model common to both.

        ...whereas the parameter sweep guys have, as data source, the SKModel

        but generic sequencers do too.
    [ ] animation-selection popover has sections
		Parameter Sweep
		Timeseries
	[ ] Name of the thing that changes over time is copied into min/max/delta

[ ] BUG: basins actually assumes an ANY descent, then shows misleading arrow-length
	 (b/c does not take degeneracy into account).
	 
	[ ] two variants of basins: ANY or STEEPEST.
	[ ] degeneracy-aware arrow length

ABOVE THE LINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BELOW THE LINE

[ ] net's arcs drawn as spherical ellipses not line segments. I.e., many tiny line
	segments.

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] verify that all the change monitor guys impl the new protocol

[ ] recheck: pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] for Delta to work, loop needs to be inside BG work item

[ ] recheck: on change flow sequencer, stepnumber doesn't get reset properly
    timing thing? -- ui updates before rule-change completes

[ ] recheck: N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

[ ] automatically select color source = population when sequencer selection changes
    to a pop-flow sequencer from sth else.

    This is 1st step in new design that de-emphasises static pictures.

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color right

[ ] something to get it past Apple's prohibition of 'niche apps' in the App Store
    "game mode"?
    maybe you get to rewire the graph?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] macOS version

[ ] UI for pop flow rule selection

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[?] move sequencer controls to page 2

[ ] only execute a clear-and-redraw when needed
    (actual frame rate is handled by . . . whom? GLKView?)

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] page 2 POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] segue from background to prev, not always back to main

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.
