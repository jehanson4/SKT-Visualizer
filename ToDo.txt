For 1.0.6


ABOVE THE LINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BELOW THE LINE

[ ] (semi-)interactive slider instead of progress bar
    reset only?
    allow jumps?

[ ] busy spinner

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] verify that all the change monitor guys impl the new protocol

[ ] pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] for Delta to work, loop needs to be inside BG work item

[ ] on change flow sequencer, stepnumber doesn't get reset properly
    timing thing: ui updates before rule-change completes

[ ] N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

    sequencer methods:
    reset() - puts it back to whatever it regards as an initial state
    step()
    reverse() -- not sure it's even used
    but nothing that says, re-derive params

[ ] basins on BG queue

[ ] automatically select color source = population when sequencer selection changes
    to a pop-flow sequencer from sth else.

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color right

[ ] Sequencer Reset button
    ...where?

[ ] block the back half of the nodes
    maybe 2 intersecting vertical flat semicircles @ phi=0 & phi=pi/2

[ ] something to get it past Apple's prohibition of 'niche apps' in the App Store
    "game mode"?
    maybe you get to rewire the graph?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] macOS version

[ ] UI for pop flow rule selection

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[?] move sequencer controls to page 2

[ ] use NSLog not print
    find out about log levels too

[ ] only execute a clear-and-redraw when needed
    (actual frame rate is handled by . . . whom? GLKView?)

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] PhysicalProperty -> DerivedProperty

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] page 2 POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] segue from background to prev, not always back to main

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.
