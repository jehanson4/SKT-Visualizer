[SRW] bifurcation. x,y are where occupation is high, but Z is energy not T

[ ] bifurcation: sort nodes by occupation, color those in top Xth percentile

[ ] blocks don't have color or relief. BlockFigure maybe not a basefigure?

[2/13/19] start, go to eq, pick a figure, change effects. switch from eq to dynamics,
choose initial figure that's got the same base as the eq one
...either doesn't update the figure, or inherits its effects settings but doesn't
update the UI correctly

[SRW 2/14/19] Do you think it would be good to make the surface opaque, so you donâ€™t
see the far side of the wireframe through the near side?

[SRW 2/14/19] I had a crash a couple of times after Reset Parameters that I cannot
reliably reproduce. FYI. Also, after one such crash, I restarted the program and the
figure refused to appear. Closing and restarting the program fixed that.

[SRW 2/14/19] On the rectangle, tap it for non-vertical perspective.
Set N=2000, k0=1000, T=1000. Graphics glitch.

[SRW 2/14/19] I suggest Parameter Sweep T as the default.

[2/15/19] busy spinner doesn't show in plane figure.


ABOVE THE LINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BELOW THE LINE

[ ] ColorsSwitch effect got lost after monkey testing

[?] pop flow calibration goes black in the middle even when recalibrated.
But maybe that's right...

plane POV doesn't recenter when you change N or k
need to find node "under" POV before & after

option to save current model params as defaults

reset model params doesn't reset the timeseries sequencer, but I think it should

figure selection has 2 sections: plane and hemi

surface

descent lines

any-descent basins

[ ] EFFECTS clean up after themselves when disabled

[?] Name of the thing that changes over time is copied into min/max/delta

[ ] degeneracy-aware arrow length

[ ] net's arcs drawn as spherical ellipses not line segments. I.e., many tiny line
	segments.

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] recheck: pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] for Delta to work, loop needs to be inside BG work item

[ ] recheck: on change flow sequencer, stepnumber doesn't get reset properly
    timing thing? -- ui updates before rule-change completes

[ ] recheck: N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color right

[ ] something to get it past Apple's prohibition of 'niche apps' in the App Store
    "game mode"?
    maybe you get to rewire the graph?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] macOS version

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.
