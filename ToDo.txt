LB, UB

autocalibrate not working w/ log data source
surface
can't zoom plane
basins
pop flow

go to 'normalized occupation' as a color source
    ...but I don't want to have to find the bounds twice
    ...so therefore put the bounds into the color source
    ...they're there already.

ABOVE THE LINE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BELOW THE LINE

[ ] restore the info page

[ ] EFFECTS clean up after themselves when disabled

[?] Name of the thing that changes over time is copied into min/max/delta

[ ] degeneracy-aware arrow length

[ ] net's arcs drawn as spherical ellipses not line segments. I.e., many tiny line
	segments.

[ ] verify: sequencers and steppers take step-size from current delta, not default

[ ] recheck: pop flow sequencer controls
    [ ] upper bound not updated in UI
    [ ] for Delta to work, loop needs to be inside BG work item

[ ] recheck: on change flow sequencer, stepnumber doesn't get reset properly
    timing thing? -- ui updates before rule-change completes

[ ] recheck: N & k0 sequencer doesn't pick up new ratio k/N
    if you stop it, change k0, start it again

[ ] automatically select color source = population when sequencer selection changes
    to a pop-flow sequencer from sth else.

    This is 1st step in new design that de-emphasises static pictures.

[ ] snapshot doesn't get background color right

[ ] something to get it past Apple's prohibition of 'niche apps' in the App Store
    "game mode"?
    maybe you get to rewire the graph?

[ ] when zoomed in, relax the clipping on v. short flowlines

[ ] macOS version

[ ] UI for pop flow rule selection

[?] relaxation flow -- use known equilibrium occupancy
    but isn't that cheating?

[?] move sequencer controls to page 2

[ ] only execute a clear-and-redraw when needed
    (actual frame rate is handled by . . . whom? GLKView?)

[ ] control for sequencer step rate

[ ] improved pointsize calc

[ ] page 2 POV controls

[ ] add texture to the sprites to make them look like balls

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*. esp at v high zoom & near center

[ ] segue from background to prev, not always back to main

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.
