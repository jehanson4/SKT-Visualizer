[ ] --- instead of None

====================================

[ ] a1 & a2 steppers not init'ed right. they get fixed by a reset

[ ] when user changes the sequencer, the old one gets sgn=0 and the new one does too

    impl the 2nd inside prepare()?
    no!
    impl it in the caller

once we've got reasonable bounds the OK to put the system inside them

[ ] reasonable bounds on sequencer that are not overwritten.
    prepare/reset DOES NOT forget them
    reset model does not forget them

    needs to wait for the partition into model/visualizaiton/presentation

[ ] popover scrolling list instead of picker

[ ] set a func whenever bounds changes so I don't have to go thru the switch

[ ] instead of PhysicalProperty.type, make an enum
    ditto the other things

[ ] width of text widget stretches automatically to fix ....
    a priority thing?

[ ] show something on startup

[ ] sequencer check status after step

[ ] when sequencer is running the controler parameter text fields all read-only
    deltas and steppers OK

[ ] reflect flaps if initial is outside range

[ ] I think we're looking at the underside of the hemisphere

[ ] app consists of 3 major parts
    model (geometry, physics incl. PhysicalProperties)
    visualization (color sources)
    presentation(effects, sequencers, POV, GL settings)
    UI (Master, Settings, Display)

    ModelController
    VisualizationController
    PresentationController

    protocol & associated user/listener protocol for each

    MAYBE we can put the control-param deltas & sequencer bounds into Visualization?

[ ] enum for the major parts
    so a sequencer (or UI control action or etc) can tell the app which kinds of part-change
    to send to which sets of listeners. Note the plural

    not enum: use bitmasks

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition

[ ] sequencers that simulate dynamics of a population of points
    steepest descent
    diffusion

[ ]  basin finder option to do a given # of iterations
    use that do make a sequencer

[ ] all the reset / revert mtds return Boolean "changed", so Scene.reset mtds can
    reduce # model change events it fires

[ ] images for the 7 buttons
    reset
    3 for BC
    3 for stepSgn
