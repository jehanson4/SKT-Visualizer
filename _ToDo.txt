with of text widget stretches automatically to fix ....
    a priority thing?

a1 & a2 steppers not init'ed right. they get fixed by a reset

show something on startup

sequencer check status after step

Ooccupation

'reasonable' bounds on sequencer that are not overwritten.
    prepare/reset DOES NOT forget them

reflect flaps if initial is outside range

I think we're looking at the underside of the hemisphere

[ ] 1 app consisting of:
    model (geometry, physics incl. PhysicalProperties)
    visualization (color sources)
    presentation(effects, sequencers, POV, GL settings)
    UI (Master, Settings, Display)

    ModelController
    VisualizationController
    PresentationController

    protocol & associated user/listener protocol for each

[ ] when user changes the sequencer, the old one gets sgn=0 and the new one does too
    once we've got reasonable bounds the OK to put the system inside them

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition

[ ] sequencers that simulate dynamics of a population of points
    steepest descent
    diffusion

[ ]  basin finder option to do a given # of iterations
    use that do make a sequencer

[ ] all the reset / revert mtds return Boolean "changed", so Scene.reset mtds can
    reduce # model change events it fires
