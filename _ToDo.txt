Q: best way to do swift dictionary keyset -> array of values

you need to change T or something in order to get the surface to show

initial generator is not what the picker shows.
ditto cycler

picker order

remove net flicker -- cf. 'artifacts' in the book; or could incr net's radius

hints: "tap to enabled disable CYCLER"

pan: if finger starts below center point, reverse pan direction
.. actually it's more complicated

? one big model class that contains physics and geometry: so I can put other things in it

frame RATE on cycler not frame COUNT

distinguish step from stepSize -- the latter is always positive

separate step direction after all, so I don't have the delta's switching sign in the UI

"Step over"?

step down in N toward 0: fail to catch the lower limit.

settings VC needs to be model change listener

    *but* does that mean I've got strong ref's to it? Does it get rebuilt or NOT?
    in either case, it's a bad thing. either there's dead listeners or it keeps
    re-adding itself.

get rid of 'coloration' in the storboard and controllers
