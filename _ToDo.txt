Q: best way to do swift dictionary keyset -> array of values

you need to change T or something in order to get the surface to show

initial coloration is not what the picker shows.

remove net flicker -- cf. 'artifacts' in the book; or could incr net's radius

hints: "tap to enabled disable CYCLER"

cyclers

reset model

generator -> coloration

better name to replace "coloration"
in Hollywood they're called "colorists"

pan: if finger starts below center point, reverse pan direction
.. actually it's more complicated

all the min's and max's are instance vars. simpler and no actual waste

one big model class that contains physics and geometry: so I can put other things in it

all the phyics or geometry constants: default deltas, values, etc go into the class's themselves
as instance const's

frame RATE on cycler not frame COUNT
