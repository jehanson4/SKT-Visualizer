==================================================================================

[ ] KForFixedKOverN bounds from UI not listening, and picking up values from geometry not control params

[ ] now that we've got buttons for up & down, don't change sign on toggle

[ ] UI indicator for whether we're on or off
    separate from sgn
    so we can know what will happen if we tap

[ ] 2 binary buttons on bottom row
    up/down
    on/off

    let the tapping do whatever, these follow it
    tapping and these back onto same var's so they're always in sync

====================================

---
[ ] FIXME strog retain cycles b/c of listeners
    cf. http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/02/05/swift-events.html

---
[ ] make the CP steppers fixed stepsize & bounds and don't permit user to change it
    ...maybe on page 2 someday if I feel like it, under "Manual Control"

---
[ ] SIMPLIFY manual stepper & sequencer should share as much as possible

Contra: makes the CP params unwieldy; and doesn't help for sequencers that aren't CPs
...which is an important class of 'em

---
[ ] page 2 has ui section for 'Parameter Defaults'
    INDEPENDENT from sequencer params
    look like CP wigets but have 1 extra nesting for parameter name
    parameter-defaults can be in a scrollview

---
[ ] Sequencer needs to think floating point even for discrete things, do keep it from getting stuck.
Maybe we'll need separate flavors for int and double adjustable params

---

[ ] sequencer numeric controls look like CP widgets

---
[ ] stepsize widget in sequencer controls

---
[ ] when user changes the sequencer, the old one gets sgn=0 and the new one does too

    impl the 2nd inside prepare()?
    no!
    impl it in the caller

[ ] popover scrolling list instead of picker

[ ] instead of PhysicalProperty.type, make an enum. ditto for anything else that uses a "type"

[ ] width of text widget stretches automatically to fix . . . a priority thing?

[ ] sequencer check status after step

[ ] when sequencer is running the controler parameter text fields all read-only
    deltas and steppers OK

[ ] I think we're looking at the underside of the hemisphere

--------

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.

[ ] sequencers that simulate dynamics of a population of points
    steepest descent
    diffusion

[ ] all the reset / revert mtds return Boolean "changed", so Scene.reset mtds can
    reduce # model change events it fires

[ ] images for the 7 buttons
    reset
    3 for BC
    3 for stepSgn

[ ] extension Int { add constants }
[ ] extension Double { add more constants }
[ ] Number is protocol w/ getter for constants appropriate to its type
