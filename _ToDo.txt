====================================

[ ] need all data entry to be in top half of the screen
sequencers get their own page
middle page has arrows to both left and right
so the info button is only on page 1

[ ] beta controls

[ ] physical properties go in registry in SKTModel
    NOT by-var-name there
    NOT in SKPhysics at all

[ ] UIStackView w/ borderColor user-defined property
[ ] UIStackView w/ shadowColor user-defined property

---------------------

[ ] basinfinder renamed & made a PhysicalProperty
    it has its own control parameter: #steps in finder alg'm
    another reason to use a tableview for choosing color source:
        can put in a UI widget for its control params

[ ] SKTModel has a Registry<PhysicalProperty>
    It does NOT expose the PhysicalProperties by name

    instead of PhysicalProperty.type, make an enum. ditto for anything else that uses a "type"

[ ] PhysicalProperty contains a dict of AdjustableParameters
    not a registry, tho.

[ ] basins color source
    better name
    color saturation goes down w/ distance from well.
    scale to get it pretty-washed-out at N/2
    boundaries are still black

[ ] Nodes effect
    custom shader. point spite is image of a ball

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger *exactly*

[ ] store & restore ("UserData"?)

[ ] custom buttons or something still

[ ] segue from background to prev, not back to main

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] FIXME strog retain cycles b/c of listeners
    cf. http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/02/05/swift-events.html

---
[ ] page 2 has ui section for 'Parameter Defaults'
    INDEPENDENT from sequencer params
    look like CP wigets but have 1 extra nesting for parameter name
    parameter-defaults can be in a scrollview

[ ] popover scrolling list instead of picker

[ ] width of text widget stretches automatically to fix . . . a priority thing?

[ ] I think we're looking at the underside of the hemisphere

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.

[ ] sequencers that simulate dynamics of a population of points
    steepest descent
    diffusion

[ ] images for 7 buttons
    reset
    3 for BC
    3 for dir/enable

[ ] "capture" the display view
