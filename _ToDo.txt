====================================

[ ] surface button is miswired

[ ] scroll & pan: track finger exactly. Depends on thetaE & zoom?

[ ] store & restore

[ ] "configuration space" -- another defined term

[ ] custom buttons or something still

[ ] beta controls

[ ] segue from background to prev, not back to main

[ ] all the monitors dict's should be lazy

[ ] FIXME strog retain cycles b/c of listeners
    cf. http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/02/05/swift-events.html

---
[ ] page 2 has ui section for 'Parameter Defaults'
    INDEPENDENT from sequencer params
    look like CP wigets but have 1 extra nesting for parameter name
    parameter-defaults can be in a scrollview

[ ] popover scrolling list instead of picker

[ ] instead of PhysicalProperty.type, make an enum. ditto for anything else that uses a "type"

[ ] width of text widget stretches automatically to fix . . . a priority thing?

[ ] when sequencer is running the controler parameter text fields all read-only
    deltas and steppers OK

[ ] I think we're looking at the underside of the hemisphere

[ ] Recursive Embedded Definition
    This idea needs refinement. the definitions are the easy bit.

[ ] sequencers that simulate dynamics of a population of points
    steepest descent
    diffusion

[ ] images for 7 buttons
    reset
    3 for BC
    3 for dir/enable
