[ ] ?

=====================

[ ] 'scene controller' as the one protocol defining all the things the UI needs to know about.
    It doesn't expose geometry or physics. It's a reswizzling to meet the needs of the UI

[ ] Q: best way to do swift dictionary keyset -> array of values

[ ] All the ViewControllers need to be model change listeners
    And the all need to have the 'scene controller' passed to them

    *but* does that mean I've got strong ref's to it? Does it get rebuilt or NOT?
    in either case, it's a bad thing. either there's dead listeners or it keeps
    re-adding itself.
