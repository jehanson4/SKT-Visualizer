1. There are 3 isotropic energy minima at config's v1, v2, v3. Energy of vertex v is
E(v) = f(a_1, d_1) + f(a_2, d_2) + f(a_3, d_3)
where a_i is depth of minimum at v_i and d_i is distance between v and v_i.

2. If we set any one of the a_i = 0, we get an SK2 lattice induced by the other 2. E.g., set a_3=0.
Then we have the SK2 lattice induced by a_1 and a_2, in which each node collects vertices with given
d_1 and d_2, and all different values of d_3. Let that SK2 lattice be in the x,y plane. We'll use
the z direction to distinguish different values of d_3.

3. Steve sez nodes are arranged in a BCC lattice. Edges go from center of the unit cube to each of
the 8 corners.

Let size of unit cube in BCC lattice = 2. Embed the nodes in simple cubic lattice of size 1. Edges
are body-diagonals in this cubic lattice. Each simple cube contains 1 edge. If you project the
edges along any of the 3 axes of the simple cubic lattice, the edges form the SK2 lattice. Note
that it's on the diagonals.

4. I want to come up with a description that works for both SK2 and SK3, but I'm getting confused
about the diagonals. In SK2, the (m,n) transitions are real edges on a (topologically) square lattice.

Start with SK2 that has a2=0, i.e., it's an SK1. The natural rep of SK1 is a line in which an edge
is a move toward or away from the v1. Lay it out along the x axis. Note that it's N edges long.

Now let a2 != 0 and spread out the nodes in the y axis according to d2. Note that v2 is pulled away
from the line and forms a corner. It's as if you grab ahold of the SK1 point that holds v2 and pull.
It spreads the line out into a net. You end up with a rectangle on a diagonal.

TO SHOW: you actually do get a square lattice. I need to be clear in the SK2 case in order to
validate it in the SK3 case.

================================================

4. IF they exiset at all, (m, n, s) coordinates map onto the BODY DIAGONAL edges of the true lattice,
not moves along the edges of the simple cubic lattice. Call the latter a,b,c. Every body diagonal move
changes all 3 of a,b,c by +/-1.

It changes AT LEAST 1 of the m,n,s by +/- 1, but I think it has to sometimes or always change 2 of them.
Maybe sometimes all three? Maybe it depends on which part of the octahedron you're in.

counting argument: given 3 numbers there are 6 moves that change 1 number.How many are there that change 2?
a+, b+
a+, b-
a+, c+
a+, c-
a-, b+
a-, b-
a-, c+
a-, c-
b+, c+
b+, c-
b-, c+
b-, c-
I count 12.

How many that change all 3?
a+, b+, c+
a+, b+, c-
a+, b-, c+
a+, b-, c-
a-, b+, c+
a-, b+, c-
a-, b-, c+
a-, b-, c-
...8

But in our case, changing m but not n requires change of s. similarly changing n but not m.
m+, s+
m+, s-
m-, s+
m-, s-
n+, s+
n+, s-
n-, s+
n-, s-

How can this be? It's not symmetrical: m and n never change together.

5. think of it like this: start with an SK2 grid. Assign s=0 to all nodes with m+n even, s=1 to all with m+n odd.
Now do it again with s=2 and s=3. repeat. Maybe we'll translate the origin down to the bottom of the octahedron.
6. What are the bounds? I think Steve said the space was an octahedron.
Put the s=0 sheet at the equator. Symmetry gives us the rest. Remember, all the edges are body diagonal
so the v_1, v_3 subspace is a square standing on one corner.

Ok, that's a way to get a BCC grid. But is it SK3?

7. How many nodes are there? In SK2 we had k_max = N/2 and m_max = k and n_max = (N-k).
We need to translate this into a linear "size".
In SK2 the "size" was given by dimensions of the rectangle in the case k = k_max

---------

The number of distinct energy states is NOT simply a function of N. It's a function of N, k0, k1, k2.

Ditto in SK2, where reducing with width increases the height so as to keep width + height = N. The number
of distinct energy states is (width+1) * (height+1) = (k+1) * (N-k+1)

---------
NO I'm all wet about the energies: equi-energy contrib's are diagonals on the SK2 grid.
