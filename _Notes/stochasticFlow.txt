SUPPOSE that there is a dynamic (aka rule aka equation of motion) that applies to the SK model. It maps
the config space onto itself: each point in the config space at time (t) is mapped to a point
in the config space at (t+1).

SUPPOSE this dynamic on SK configuration space has the following properties. (If any are inherent, SHOW them instead of supposing them.)
1. It is stochastic: the ouput may be to some extent random
2. The evolution of a probability distribution over the space is given by weighted sum over
    evolution of point dist's.
3. Its output is local: a point is mapped to itself or a neighbor.
4. Its input is local: the mapping at a point is dependent only on the properties of the point and its neighbors, and on exogenous factors such as temperature
5. The only point properties used as inputs are ones that are covariant under mapping to 2D shell.
    I.e., just energy.

TO DO: map dynamics of probability distro in SK configuration space onto dynamics of probabilty distro
in the 2D shell.
